# vim-colors-plain

This is a fork of [andreypopp/vim-colors-plain](https://github.com/andreypopp/vim-colors-plain) which is being developed based on my
personal taste.

## Installation & Usage

With [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) you add this to the `.vimrc`:

```
Plug 'vivi168/vim-colors-plain'
```

Then:

```
set background=light " Set to dark for a dark variant
colorscheme plain
```
